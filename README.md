# penguins-dhcpd-proxy

Eggs use this DHCPD PROXY server to provide PXE boot information to the clients, it need the presence of a standard DHCPD server on the LAN, but You don't need to reconfigure it to add PXE fields.

This project started on the only nodejs I found: FOGProject [node-dhcproxy](https://github.com/FOGProject/node-dhcproxy=.

Reference:
* [node-dhcproxy](https://github.com/FOGProject/node-dhcproxy) node-dhcproxy is based on [node-dhcpd](https://github.com/glaszig/node-dhcpd)
